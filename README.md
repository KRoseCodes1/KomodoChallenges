# KomodoChallenges
Kacie Kasner's Gold Badge Final Project for Eleven Fifty Academy

KomodoCafe = Challenge 1 -- basic project using repository method and lists
KomodoClaims = Challenge 2 -- uses queues to add and remove new claims
KomodoBadges = Challenge 3 -- uses dictionaries (I made a list also because I was unsure of how to store the name of the badge outside of a separate updating list)
